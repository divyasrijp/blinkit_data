Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard design

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Visual representation of data insights

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive data analysis environment

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection

The dataset from Blinkit (formerly Grofers) includes product details, sales, customer information, and store-level data.
The CSV file was imported into Python for cleaning and further analysis.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data cleaning was performed using Python to ensure high-quality and consistent data for analysis.
Key steps included:

Handling missing and null values

Removing duplicates

Renaming and restructuring columns

Formatting data types (e.g., dates, numerical values)

Ensuring uniformity across records

3️⃣ Data Storage and Integration

After cleaning, the processed data was uploaded into a PostgreSQL database for structured storage.
This allowed easy querying and advanced analytics using SQL.

4️⃣ Data Analysis Using SQL

SQL queries were used to uncover key insights such as:

Total revenue and average sales

Top-selling products and categories

Most profitable outlets

Sales performance by location and outlet size

Correlation between visibility, rating, and sales

Outlet type contributing the highest revenue

These analyses helped identify growth opportunities and areas needing improvement.

5️⃣ Data Visualization in Power BI

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize insights clearly and effectively.
The dashboard includes visuals such as:

Total Sales and Revenue by Outlet Type

Product Category-wise Performance

Average Rating Distribution

Sales by Outlet Size and Location

Top Performing Products
